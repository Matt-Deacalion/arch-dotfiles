# Arch Dotfiles

These are the the bootstrap ‘dotfiles’ I use on all of my Arch Linux boxes. I've kept it clean and simple with only the configs for Vim, Bash and Git included at the moment.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Matt-Stevens/arch-dotfiles.git && cd arch-dotfiles && ./install.sh
```
