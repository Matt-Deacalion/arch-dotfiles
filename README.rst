===================
Solid Arch Dotfiles
===================

A set of elegant dotfiles in the spirit of Arch Linux that will give you a development boon. These
are kept as sharp as possible by constant use and honing.

+ `Aliases`_ for networking, pacman, statistics etc.
+ `Functions`_ for controlling services, extracting/compressing files, encryption etc.
+ A slick `vimrc`_ ideal for Python development.

Installation
------------
This **will not** overwrite any of your existing dotfiles. It will tell you which conflicting files
you have to move before re-trying the install again.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ curl -L https://git.io/vybNs | python -
